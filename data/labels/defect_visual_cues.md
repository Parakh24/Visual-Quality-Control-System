PCB Defect Types & Visual Cues

1. Solder Bridge
- Excess solder connecting adjacent pads
- Appears as shiny blob between tracks

2. Missing Solder Joint
- Component pin not connected to pad
- Visible gap or dull pad

3. Burn Marks
- Dark or blackened PCB areas
- Irregular texture or discoloration

These cues will be used later to validate Grad-CAM heatmaps.
